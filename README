This is the first commit of this project.

The objective of this project is to integrate the Monte Carlo stochastic process to create forecasts with confidence, as to what we can predict to see
with individual equities in the next year.

This model uses the equation: dSt​=μSt​dt+σSt​dWt​ ... where:
St = Price at time t
mu = Expected rate of return (Historical growth per day)
sigma = volatility (Historical Volatility per day)
Wt = Standard Brownian Motion (Noise)

This equation is then put into a log path, to allow for a more rational (normal) distribution:
ln(St​)=ln(S0​)+(μ−21​σ2)t+σWt​...where:
S0 = Initial stock value (Current Price)

Finally, to convert our logpaths into real stock prices, we place our logpath as an exponent to the constant e,
which cancels our ln.
S=S0​×e^(log_paths)

We then run the line: final_prices = S[:, -1] . Here, S is our array of calculated prices per day, which we slice by
using this line to define our variable final_prices as a collection of all of our final prices after T = 1.
The expected_final line then takes the mean of these to give a rational prediction based on our model as to what we
can expect the price of the equity to be 1 year from now (252 trading days).
